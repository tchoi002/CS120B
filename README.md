Jukebox is a partially automated music-playing device that will play a user selected song from the self-contained media. The classic juke box has buttons with letters and numbers on them, when entered in combination, are used to play a specific selection. My goal is to create a simplified version of this embedded system. I recreated the juke box with a Atmega 1284 microcontroller on a breadboard. There is LCD Screen in start mode to display welcome note and instruction. It also displayed list of songs that contained in the jukebox. There are buttons to press left or right to know what songs are available in the jukebox. User can press the number corresponding to the song to select and play the song. The piezo buzzer will start playing the song. User can also press button to stop song or pause song. The LCD Screen will always display the song title of the song that is playing. When the song is playing, there are also LED to react to each beat of the song that is playing. LEDâ€™s visual feature is a bonus, which gives user a better visual experience.
